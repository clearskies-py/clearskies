# Documentation for clearskies

Note that this is not meant to be readable in git.
Rather, this is used to build the documentation site published at clearskies.info.  
This has a few components:

| folder | description |
|--------|-------------|
| jekyll | The skeleton of a jekyll blog including some of the documentation |
| python | A clearskies application that builds the rest of the documentation from the docblocks in clearskies |
| build  | A temporary directory that is populated with a full jekyll site that powers clearskies.info |

This lives in the main clearskies repo because the documentation for clearskies lives primarily in the codebase itself.  
As clearskies is updated, so are the docblocks (as well as tests for all the examples in the docblocks).
The build process is also updated as necessary. As a result, it's possible to check out any version of clearskies and
build the documentation site for that specific clearskies version.

## Launching the docs

```bash
cd python
poetry run python build.py
cd ../build
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then open your browser to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

Naturally, you'll need ruby insalled as well as [bundle](https://bundler.io/).
